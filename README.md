###
Let's put a version control demo into action!:
1) fork this repository
  (insert pic pointing to fork, say username should look like name/getting-started)

2) clone fork to local machine
  (insert pic pointing to clone or download, if you have a code editing software copy https and clone in code editor's environment)

3) Edit this README document, sign your name at the bottom!
  (pic of where to click for edit and where to put your name)
  
4) Commit your change  
    + From a git-aware terminal:
      + Create a branch on the local ('downstream') side.  
        ```checkout -b <my-branch-name>```  
      + Track changes for the read-me page  
        ```git add README.md```  
      + Commit your changes to the page  
        ```git commit```  
      + Create a useful commit message. First line is title (<54 chars), rest is body (<79 chars / line).  
        ```EDITOR=nano git commit --amend```
      + Send your changes upstream  
        ```git push --set-upstream origin <my-branch-name>```  
    + On GitHub:
      + Refresh browser
      + Select your branch
      + Submit a pull request with a helpful commit message (<79 chars per line)  
  (pic of where to click for each of these)

Yay you're done!
