How to get started with Open Source contributions

For more in depth documentation, here are some git and github tutorials

Let's put a version control demo into action!:
1) fork this repository
  (insert pic pointing to fork, say username should look like name/getting-started)

2) clone fork to local machine
  (insert pic pointing to clone or download, if you have a code editing software copy https and clone in code editor's environment)

3) Edit this README document, sign your name at the bottom!
  (pic of where to click for edit and where to put your name)
  
4) Commit changes with short summary of your change (in this case, change can be "added name Rosay2109") git pull (always pull when you're    editing previous code), git push
  (pic of where to click for each of these)
